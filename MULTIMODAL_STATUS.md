# Chrome Prompt API Multimodal Status & Troubleshooting

## Current Situation

According to the Chrome documentation, **multimodal capabilities (image input) are currently in origin trial** and **not yet available in Chrome Stable**. This means:

- ‚úÖ **Text-only Prompt API**: Available in Chrome Stable
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Image input (multimodal)**: Only available in Chrome Canary/Dev with experimental features
- üö´ **Chrome Stable**: Multimodal features not yet supported

## What We've Implemented

### 1. Improved Error Detection

- Better checking for multimodal availability
- Specific error messages explaining Chrome requirements
- Fallback when multimodal isn't available

### 2. Fallback Functionality

When image analysis isn't available, the extension now:

- Uses text-only Prompt API to analyze image context
- Provides helpful information based on:
  - Image URL and filename
  - Source webpage context
  - File type and website domain
- Clearly indicates this is a context-based analysis

### 3. Progressive Enhancement

```javascript
// The system now tries:
1. Check if multimodal is available
2. If yes: Use full image analysis
3. If no: Use intelligent context-based fallback
4. If all fails: Provide clear error message
```

## Testing the Current Implementation

### Using Chrome Stable

1. Right-click on any image
2. Select "Describe image with ClarifAI"
3. You should get a **context-based description** like:

```
**Image Analysis (Context-based)**

Based on the image URL ending in `.jpg` and being from `wikipedia.org`
on a page about "Solar System", this image likely contains:
1. An astronomical photograph or diagram
2. Planets, stars, or space-related imagery
3. Educational content suitable for an encyclopedia entry
...

*Note: This description is based on context clues since direct image
analysis requires Chrome with experimental AI features enabled.*
```

### Using Chrome Canary/Dev

1. Enable experimental features in `chrome://flags/`
2. Look for flags related to "AI" or "experimental web platform features"
3. Restart Chrome
4. Right-click on images should now provide **actual image analysis**

## How to Enable Full Image Analysis

### Option 1: Chrome Canary/Dev Channel

1. Download Chrome Canary or Chrome Dev
2. Navigate to `chrome://flags/`
3. Search for:
   - "Experimental Web Platform features"
   - "Origin trials"
   - Any AI-related flags
4. Enable relevant flags and restart

### Option 2: Wait for Chrome Stable

- Google is gradually rolling out these features
- Expected to be available in Chrome Stable in future versions
- Timeline depends on Google's rollout schedule

## Testing Commands

You can test the current implementation in the browser console:

```javascript
// Test what's available
await window.testPromptApiAvailability();

// Test image description (will use appropriate method)
await window.testImageDescription();

// Test all functionality
await window.testPromptApi();
```

## Expected Behavior Now

### ‚úÖ What Should Work (Chrome Stable)

- Context menu appears on images
- Extension popup opens
- Context-based image analysis using text AI
- Helpful information about what image likely contains
- Clear indication that full analysis needs newer Chrome

### ‚úÖ What Should Work (Chrome Canary/Dev with flags)

- Everything above PLUS
- Actual visual analysis of image content
- Detailed descriptions of what's actually in the image
- Text recognition from images
- Color and composition analysis

### ‚ùå What Won't Work

- Direct image analysis in Chrome Stable (expected)
- Analysis if no AI features are available at all

## Error Messages You Might See

### "Chrome Prompt API with image support is not available"

- **Cause**: Using Chrome Stable or flags not enabled
- **Solution**: Use Chrome Canary/Dev with experimental flags, or wait for stable release

### "Multimodal image description is not supported"

- **Cause**: Browser doesn't support image input to AI
- **Solution**: Update to newer Chrome version or enable experimental features

### "NotSupportedError DOMException"

- **Cause**: API called with unsupported parameters
- **Solution**: The fallback should handle this automatically

## Next Steps

1. **Test the fallback**: Verify context-based descriptions work in Chrome Stable
2. **Test with Chrome Canary**: Try with experimental features enabled
3. **Monitor Chrome updates**: Features may become available in stable releases
4. **User communication**: Clearly explain current limitations to users

The implementation now gracefully handles the current state of Chrome's AI APIs while providing the best possible experience given the constraints.
