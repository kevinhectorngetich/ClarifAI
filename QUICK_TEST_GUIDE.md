# Quick Test Guide for Context Menu Fixes

## What Was Fixed

1. **Shortened welcome message**: Now just says "Hello! I'm ClarifAI. What can I help you with?"
2. **Better error handling**: Removed strict user activation requirement that was breaking context menu
3. **Improved fallback responses**: Now provides actual explanations for common concepts like ECMAScript
4. **More resilient summarizer creation**: Tries multiple approaches if the first one fails

## Testing Steps

### 1. Test Basic Functionality

1. Build and load the extension: `npm run build` then load `dist` folder in Chrome
2. Open the popup normally - should see short welcome message
3. Type "What is ECMAScript" - should get a proper explanation even if Chrome AI isn't available

### 2. Test Context Menu (The Main Fix)

1. Go to any webpage
2. Select the text "ECMAScript" (or any other text)
3. Right-click â†’ "Explain ECMAScript with ClarifAI"
4. The popup should open and provide an explanation instead of the error you saw before

### 3. Test Other Common Terms

Try the context menu with these terms to test fallback responses:

- "JavaScript"
- "HTML"
- "CSS"
- "React"
- "API"

### 4. Test Chrome AI (If Available)

If you have Chrome 115+ with experimental AI features:

1. Go to `chrome://flags`
2. Search for "Experimental AI"
3. Enable relevant flags
4. Restart Chrome
5. Test again - should use Chrome's AI instead of fallbacks

## Expected Results

### âœ… **Working**:

- Short welcome message
- Context menu appears on right-click
- Fallback explanations for common programming terms
- No more "User activation required" errors

### ðŸ”§ **May Still Need Chrome AI Setup**:

- For complex, non-common terms
- For webpage summarization
- For context-aware explanations

## Debug Commands

If you still see issues, check the console:

```javascript
// In background script console:
chrome.contextMenus.removeAll();

// In popup console:
chrome.storage.local.get(["pendingRequest"]).then(console.log);

// In any webpage console:
console.log("Summarizer available:", !!window.Summarizer);
```

The main issue was that the context menu trigger wasn't considered "user activation" by Chrome's strict requirements, so now it gracefully handles that and provides helpful fallback explanations.
