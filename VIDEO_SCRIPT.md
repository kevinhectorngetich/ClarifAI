# ClarifAI Chrome Extension - Video Script

**Duration: ~2.5 minutes**

---

## üé¨ **Opening Hook** (0:00 - 0:20)

_Screen: Frustrated developer looking at complex documentation_

**Narration:**
"When I was learning to code, a sage once told me: 'Documentation should be your best friend.' I was learning Flutter at the time, so I dove into the documentation. It recommended I learn Dart first, so I opened the Dart docs... and honestly? It was overwhelming.

_Screen: Show old, dense documentation pages_

While the Dart docs have since been updated and are much more beginner-friendly, many technical documents still present complex concepts with brief examples, assuming you already know the fundamentals."

---

## üéØ **Problem Introduction** (0:20 - 0:40)

_Screen: Multiple tabs open, user scrolling through dense documentation_

**Narration:**
"Picture this: You're trying to understand a new API, but the documentation is dense. You're jumping between multiple tabs, trying to piece together how everything connects. You don't have time to read through hundreds of pages, but you need to understand specific implementations quickly.

_Screen: Show user struggling with complex technical content_

This is where ClarifAI comes to the rescue."

---

## üöÄ **Solution Introduction** (0:40 - 1:00)

_Screen: ClarifAI logo and Chrome extension installation_

**Narration:**
"I built ClarifAI, a Chrome extension that leverages Google's cutting-edge built-in AI APIs to instantly clarify and summarize any web content. With Chrome introducing Gemini Nano through the Summarizer and Prompt APIs, I saw an opportunity to revolutionize how we learn from technical documentation."

_Screen: Show Chrome flags and AI features being enabled_

**On-screen text:** "Uses Chrome's Built-in AI - No external APIs required"

---

## üé• **Feature Demonstration 1: Context Menu** (1:00 - 1:30)

_Screen: Navigate to React documentation page_

**Narration:**
"Let me show you how it works. I'm on the React documentation, looking at hooks. Instead of reading through everything..."

_Screen: Right-click on a link_

"I can right-click any link and select 'Explain with ClarifAI' to get an instant preview of what's behind that link without opening it."

_Screen: Show the explanation appearing in the popup_

"Or I can highlight any complex text..."

_Screen: Highlight technical jargon_

"Right-click, and get a beginner-friendly explanation instantly."

_Screen: Show the Feynman-style explanation_

---

## üé• **Feature Demonstration 2: Page Summarization** (1:30 - 2:00)

_Screen: Open ClarifAI popup_

**Narration:**
"But that's not all. I can summarize entire pages in multiple formats."

_Screen: Click "Summarize Current Page" to expand options_

"I have four options: Key Points for bullet-point summaries, TL;DR for quick overviews, Teaser for the most interesting parts, or Headline for the main takeaway."

_Screen: Click "Key Points" and show the generation process_

"Watch as the Chrome Summarizer API processes the content..."

_Screen: Show progress bar and then the generated summary_

"And there we have it! Notice how the panel automatically minimizes to give me maximum reading space."

---

## üé• **Feature Demonstration 3: Chat Interface** (2:00 - 2:20)

_Screen: Use the chat interface_

**Narration:**
"I can also have a conversation about the content. Let me ask about something specific..."

_Screen: Type "How do useEffect dependencies work?"_

"The AI uses the current page context to provide relevant, contextual answers. And with one click..."

_Screen: Click copy button_

"I can copy any response to share with my team or save for later."

---

## üîß **Technical Highlight** (2:20 - 2:35)

_Screen: Show Chrome DevTools with API calls_

**Narration:**
"What makes ClarifAI exceptional is that it uses Chrome's built-in AI APIs. The Summarizer API handles content analysis, while the Prompt API powers the conversational features. Everything runs locally on your device - no external API keys, no privacy concerns, and lightning-fast responses."

_Screen: Show API documentation/features_

---

## üéØ **Closing & Impact** (2:35 - 2:50)

_Screen: Before/after comparison of learning efficiency_

**Narration:**
"ClarifAI transforms how we learn from technical content. Instead of spending hours parsing through documentation, you get instant, contextual understanding. Whether you're a bootcamp student learning React, a developer exploring new APIs, or a researcher analyzing technical papers..."

_Screen: Show different use cases quickly_

"ClarifAI makes complex knowledge accessible and learning efficient."
